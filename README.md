# Mapping AI research over the past 20 years
Welcome to William Hoover's repository for the Data Visualization and Modeling Research Project conducted online at Full Sail University. This project encapsulates an in-depth analysis and visualization of the progression of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence research over the past two decades, leveraging data from arxiv.org.

Project Overview:

The primary objective of this endeavor was to utilize data visualization techniques to map the rate and nature of AI and ML research advancements over the past 20 years. By pulling titles of all related papers from arxiv.org, a clear depiction of how the focus and volume of research have evolved was created.

Repository Content:

    Data Acquisition:
        Automated script to fetch titles of ML and AI-related papers from arxiv.org using its API.

    Data Processing:
        Scripts for cleaning and organizing the data to prepare it for visualization.

    Interactive GUI:
        An executable for an interactive GUI that allows users to update the data, view graphs representing the evolution of AI and ML research, and save these graphs locally.

    Visualization Scripts:
        Scripts used to generate various visualizations mapping the rate and nature of research in AI and ML over the specified timeframe.

    Save Functionality:
        Feature to save updated graphs to any location on the user's computer via a "save" button in the menu bar.

    Final Report:
        A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, findings, and significance of the visualizations generated.

Technologies Used:

    Python
    Various Data Visualization Libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
    arxiv.org API
